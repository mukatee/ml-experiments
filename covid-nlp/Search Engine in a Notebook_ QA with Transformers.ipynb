These are not intended to be direct answers (in all cases) but to point to relevant papers and highlight potentially interesting points that specific papers cover related to the task questions.\n\nFrom the technical perspective this uses [TF-IDF scores](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%E2%80%93idf) across the papers to find papers related to the questions, sorts them according to these scores, and then uses the [Huggingface Transformers library](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) and its [Question-Answers model (pipeline)](https://huggingface.co/transformers/main_classes/pipelines.html#questionansweringpipeline) to answer the questions. \n\nThe answers given by the model are ranked by the confidence given by the model. Only answers above a specific confidence threshold are selected. The threshold confidence is varied across questions based on running the model with the question on a smaller subset and tuning the threshold to what produces useful results for that questions (in my opinion).\n\nI believe the results are most useful to help someone going through a large body of research to find interesting papers to look into that they might have otherwise not noticed, or to help focus search over large sets of documents. Perhaps to highlights some ideas that could otherwise be missed."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"8f2839f25d086af736a60e9eeb907d3b93b6e0e5","_cell_guid":"b1076dfc-b9ad-4769-8c92-a6c4dae69d19","trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import os\nimport numpy as np\nimport pandas as pd \nfrom memory_profiler import profile\nfrom typing import List\nimport pickle\nfrom gensim.models.word2vec import Word2Vec\n\nfrom tqdm.auto import tqdm\ntqdm.pandas()\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Install some profiling tools to help track where the memory and CPU goes:"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install memory_utils","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_kg_hide-output":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"!pip install codeprofile","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"import memory_utils\nfrom codeprofile import profiler","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"Set a few parameters that are used later in the notebook.

And the last one would be the lowest score. Which I may have capped at some small value when the index was created, to save space and computation.\n\nIn any case, this index allows to quickly look up related documents with highest scores for words of interest.

impressive with how well the transformers question-answering model was able to find matching information in large sets of text. And my approach to find relevant documents to ask about, using TF-IDF scores for keywords across the documents seemed to work quite well. \n\nNext time I do a literature search on something, I will definitely look into trying this in my own areas of research. In that situation, I would likely be better off finding ways to finetune and identify when it finds the most relevant papers and information, and how to best apply it. Of course, the research community still ha some way to go to having nice sets of papers available in a suitable format for this type of processing. Here, Kaggle has done it for us, but in my experience raw PDF is what you mostly get.\n\nBut as I said, I found the results and their quality very interesting. I think such an approach could be quite helpful to identify documents and topics in large sets of text when researching some specific problems. For example, to\n- Find missed documents that could be highly relevant\n- Group different insights quickly\n- Reduce a large set of documents to go through manually\n- Highlight new ideas and viewpoints that could otherwise be missed\n\nI believe this type of service would be a useful helping tool for literature search in any domain. For academic texts, further improvements could include:\n- Ranking by journal (higher ranked journals get more points)\n- In quite many cases I see titles give good indicators of usefulness as well. Weighting different article elements in general, in scoring, could be an option.\n- Fancy UI for a search engine to let you explore the results\n- Integrating explorative data analysis approaches with tuning the keywords, questions, hyperparameters, and results\n- Running multiple queries in parallel, assuming you have the resources\n- Using previous question answers to produce more detailed questions. For example, when running this notebook, a question about vaccines lists many random looking items in the answers, but also things like rVSV-ZEBOV, which seems to be an experimental Ebola vaccine. Such terms could further be used to guide the search.\n- The answers given by the transformer model are very short and concide. Slicing larger parts of text near the answer could make it easire to directly deduce if it is worth the effor to explore that answer with a more in-depth manual review of the paper.\n\nHope this is helpful for some researcher :)"},{"metadata":{"trusted":true,"_kg_hide-input":true,"_kg_hide-output":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"profiler.print_run_stats()","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"language":"python","display_name":"Python 3","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","version":"3.6.4","file_extension":".py","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"name":"python","mimetype":"text/x-python"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":4}
